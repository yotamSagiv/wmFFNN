# Working memory chunking feedforward net model

This repository contains code for a summer undergraduate independent research project, in which I looked at chunking of 
hidden layer representations in a feedforward neural network solving a working memory task.

Network model code (NNmodel.m) is provided by Sebastian Musslick. The remaining code is authored by me.
